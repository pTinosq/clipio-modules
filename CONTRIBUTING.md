# Contributing to Clipio Modules

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Clipio Modules repository! By contributing your modules, you help expand the range of features and customizations available to the Clipio community.

To ensure a smooth contribution process, please read and follow the guidelines outlined below.

## Module Submission Guidelines

When submitting a module to the Clipio Modules repository, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- Each module should be organized in a folder with the following structure: `githubusername-module-name`.
  Here are some examples: `ptinosq-to-uppercase` | `orattray-remove-spaces` | `johndoe-extract-urls`
- The module folder must contain a `module-manifest.json` file, which provides specific information about the module. (Please refer to the provided `TEMPLATE` directory for an example of the manifest file structure.)
- The module folder must include a JavaScript file, typically named `module.js`, which exports a function called `run`. This function is the entry point for the module's functionality.
- Ensure that your module follows best practices and adheres to any relevant coding standards.
- Test your module locally to ensure it works as expected and does not conflict with other modules or the core functionality of Clipio.
